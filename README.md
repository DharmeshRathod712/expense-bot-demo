🧾 NirviSha - The AI Expense Bot
"From crumpled receipts to structured ledgers in seconds."

NirviSha is an AI-powered SaaS platform that automates expense collection for Chartered Accountants (CAs). By combining the ubiquity of WhatsApp with the multimodal intelligence of Google Gemini, we turn a chaotic monthly ritual into a seamless, instant workflow.

💡 Inspiration
In India, CAs and tax professionals face a chaotic monthly struggle: collecting thousands of financial documents from clients. These documents arrive as crumpled receipts, blurry WhatsApp photos, or PDFs scattered across emails.

We realized that while CAs use sophisticated software for filing taxes, the process of collecting and digitizing the data is still manually done by junior staff. We asked:

"What if a client could just WhatsApp a photo of their bill, and an AI Agent instantly structured it into the accounting ledger?"

That's how NirviSha was born.

🚀 What It Does
NirviSha is a Multi-Tenant SaaS Platform integrated with a WhatsApp AI Agent.

For the Client (The "Zero-UI" Experience): - Clients simply chat with our verified WhatsApp Bot.

They send images of invoices, bills, restaurant receipts, or petrol slips. No new apps to install.

The AI Brain (Google Gemini): - The bot uses Gemini's multimodal capabilities to "see" the image.

It intelligently extracts key fields: Date, Merchant Name, Total Amount, Tax, and Category.

It handles Indian context effortlessly (e.g., distinguishing between "SGST" and "Grand Total").

For the CA (The Dashboard): - Data appears instantly on a secure Web Dashboard.

Transactions are auto-categorized and ready for review.

One-Click Export to Excel/Tally compatible formats.

🔮 What's Next for NirviSha
Anomaly Detection: Acting as a first-line auditor, Gemini will warn users if a bill looks like a duplicate or if the tax amount doesn't match the standard percentage.

Tally Integration: Direct API integration with Tally/Zoho Books.

Voice Notes: Allow clients to add voice context ("This was a client dinner") which Gemini will transcribe and attach to the record.
